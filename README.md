## 02_Tuesday
* JavaScript Exercises - Period 2 Day-1
(Task 1-4 Complete, 5 not complete)

## 03_Wedensday
* AJAX with fetch and DOM manipulation
(Task 1-3 complete, task 4 not obligatory, not complete)

## 04_Thursday
* jsonserver_w_errors
(Just the code handed out)

* userappFinal
- userappFinal is filled with test data from the task to set it up. When we tried implementing CORS to this task we were able to hit the array of data from our own project, but not include any functionality methods without a CORS error. The app is set up to show the working solution with test data and is not displaying the CORS array hit.

## 05_Friday
* (not done, no time to execute this task as we were behind with the initial tasks allready and couldn't work over the weekend.)
